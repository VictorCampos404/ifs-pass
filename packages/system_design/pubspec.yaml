  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - assets/images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: CustomIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/src/assets/fonts/CustomIcons.ttf

    # - family: Inter
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: packages/system_design/lib/src/assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
    #       weight: 400
    #     - asset: packages/system_design/lib/src/assets/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
    #       weight: 500
    #     - asset: packages/system_design/lib/src/assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
    #       weight: 600
  #
  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
